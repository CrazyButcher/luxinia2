luxinia 2 is the successor of luxinia 1.x

CURRENTLY HEAVILY WORK IN PROGRESS, ONLY PARTS OF
BACKEND ARE TESTED (luxcore/luxmath) DONT USE YET

The major change is that it uses luajit2.x's capability
to call native C functions and the engine itself is 
implemented in Lua. The backend is mostly written
in C and should be cross-platform capable, although
typically visual studio is used.

While version 1 has more features for game purposes
(sound, collision, particles, animation ..), 
version 2 is designed to be a rendering sandbox and
easier to integrate in regular Lua projects (Lua owns
the mainloop)

A related project is the wxLua based EstrelaEditor
http://www.luxinia.de/index.php/Estrela which will
get tightly knit with luxinia2
