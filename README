luxinia 2 is the spiritual successor of luxinia 1.x

While version 1 was a complete game-engine with many
features (sound, collision, particles, animation ..), 
version 2 is designed to be an experimental sandbox and
easier to integrate in regular Lua projects (Lua owns
the mainloop)

Constantly work in progress, loose framework

The major change is that it uses luajit2.x's capability
to call native C functions, hence more functionality is 
written in Lua

The luxbackend is mostly written in C and should be 
cross-platform capable, although typically visual studio
is used. It doesn't have to be used and simply exists
for conveniance.

A related project is the wxLua based IDE Estrela
http://www.luxinia.de/index.php/Estrela 
now advanced and maintained by ZeroBrane
http://studio.zerobrane.com/
which is tightly knit with luxinia2 and allows easy
debugging.
