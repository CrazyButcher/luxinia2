LuaJIT gfx sandbox
-----------------------------------
(c) 2009-2016 by Christoph Kubisch

Simple framework to run some directed Vulkan and OpenGL tests.

See LICENSE for details (MIT) and 3RDPARTY for
other libraries used in this project.

Similar frameworks can be found here:

* https://github.com/malkia/ufo 
* http://www.luapower.com (most binaries and lua modules are taken from here)

This repository was once called luxinia2, however it never turned into the sucessor of [luxinia1](https://github.com/pixeljetstream/luxinia1) but really is meant as basic sandbox for directed tests.

# IDE Support
It is best used with the [ZeroBraneStudio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/) IDE and the [zbstudio-graphicscodepack](https://github.com/pixeljetstream/zbstudio-graphicscodepack).
